==================

An easy to to use stats monitor for League of Legends


## Dependencies ##
As long as there are no compiled files, the following dependencies are required:
`python3`
If you have python3 installed, install the following requirements with pip:
`pip install riotwatcher pyqt5`

## Install Instructions ##
1. Install all the required dependencies
2. git clone, with: `git clone https://github.com/r4nd0wn/r4.git`

## Usage ##
* Start the programm while you are in the r4 directory with python3 mainoo.py
* Insert your ApiKey and press update ApiKey
* Insert your AccountID and press update AccountID
* Press Start Button.
  * This will start a background proccess. You should watch the console for errors, they will be displayed here.
  * If you get an error and the program is still up, watch the error code/location and it is very common that you can just press start again
* To stop receiving Informations from the api, press the Stop button.

## Configuration ##
There is no configuration file yet, but I is already on my to do list. If you are to lazy to paste your account ID every time you open the programm, you can hardcode it into mainoo.py. Just replace the acccountid string.
